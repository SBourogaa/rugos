**RugOS** is a lightweight control plane for managing a distributed system of nodes using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [K3s](https://k3s.io/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). It‚Äôs infrastructure automation, monitoring, and orchestration in one cohesive pile of tooling.

This repository holds all the configuration files, playbooks, and scripts required to stand up a fully functioning, semi-obedient fleet of machines.

## üß† Core Components

### Distributed Architecture

RugOS organizes a distributed network of Linux nodes into a loosely-coordinated hive of chaos featuring:

- Dedicated subnet (`10.42.0.0/24`) for inter-node communication
- Control node (`rugctl`): makes decisions, issues orders, runs the show
- Worker nodes (`ruglet-*`): do the grunt work, suffer in silence
- Shared monitoring and telemetry

### Automation

[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) automates everything ‚Äî from provisioning to updates to the occasional ritual reboot. Write once, pray every time.

### Monitoring

Nobody likes surprises, and there will be plenty of those, so RugOS uses:

- **Prometheus** for scraping metrics
- **Grafana** for staring at graphs and pretending things are under control
- **Node Exporter** on each node to gather system-level data

#### Features:

- 15-second scrape intervals, so you can observe your failures in near real-time
- Automatic host labeling (control vs workers)
- Per-node dashboards
- Separate graph panels for CPU, memory, disk, and regrets

### Container Orchestration

[K3s](https://k3s.io/) is used for container orchestration. It‚Äôs a lightweight, fast Kubernetes distribution that boots quickly and crashes dramatically less often than expected.

- K3s server runs on `rugctl`
- Workers run as agents (with optional taints for specific deployments)
- Custom pod network on CIDR `10.44.0.0/16`
- Services deployed via `kubectl`, YAML, and hopium.

## üì° Network Setup

### Interfaces & Internet Sharing (ICS)

RugOS assumes you‚Äôll share internet from the control node to the ruglets over a wired NIC.

- **Wi-Fi uplink (control):** `wlp8s0` (example)
- **Wired downlink (to ruglets):** `enp9s0` (example)
- **RugOS LAN:** `10.42.0.0/24` (gateway `10.42.0.1`)

Enable ICS:
```bash
./scripts/ics.py --wifi wlp8s0 --ethernet enp9s0 --ip-range 10.42.0.0/24
```

Disable ICS:

```bash
./scripts/ics.py --clear --wifi wlp8s0 --ethernet enp9s0
```

**Note**: The script refuses to auto-pick interfaces if multiple Wi-Fi/Ethernet candidates exist. Pass `--wifi` / `--ethernet` to disambiguate.

## üß∞ Requirements

* Linux nodes (Control: Arch Linux; Workers: Ubuntu)
* SSH access via ed25519 keypair
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) on the control node
* [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) for provisioning

## üöÄ Deploying RugOS

1. Set up environment:

```bash
echo "K3S_TOKEN=your-randomly-generated-token-here" > .env
echo "GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here" >> .env
```

2. Start control plane:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

3. Verify node connectivity:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory.yml ansible/playbooks/ping.yml
```

4. Deploy system components:

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/monitor_setup.yml -K
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/registries_setup.yml -K
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/k3s_kubectl_setup.yml -K
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/k3s_setup.yml -K
```

## üî≠ Access Points

* Grafana: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Prometheus: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
* Node Exporter: `http://<node>:9100/metrics`
* K3s API: `https://10.42.0.1:6443`

## üõ†Ô∏è Helpful Commands

### Kubernetes (K3s)

```bash
# List all nodes in the cluster and their status.
kubectl get nodes
```

```bash
# Get detailed information about a specific node ‚Äî including conditions, resource allocations, and taints.
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

```bash
# List every pod across all namespaces.
kubectl get pods -A
```

```bash
# Fetch logs for a pod.
kubectl logs -n <namespace> <pod-name>
```

```bash
# Print the API endpoints of the cluster.
kubectl cluster-info
```

```bash
# Show CPU and memory usage per node.
kubectl top nodes
```

### Docker

```bash
# View all running containers.
docker ps
```

```bash
# Get logs from the Prometheus container.
docker logs prometheus
```

```bash
# Restart a service.
docker restart <service>
```

```bash
# Live CPU, memory, I/O stats for each container.
docker stats
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# Check which Prometheus targets are up/down.
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets
```

```bash
# Raw output of system metrics from Node Exporter.
curl http://<ip-address>:9100/metrics
```

### Ansible

```bash
# Show all defined hosts in your inventory.
ansible all --list-hosts
```

```bash
# Full inventory dump, including vars.
ansible-inventory --list
```

```bash
# Run a shell command across all ruglet nodes.
ansible ruglets -m shell -a "uptime"
```

```bash
# Memory usage across the fleet.
ansible ruglets -m shell -a "free -m"
```

```bash
# Disk usage.
ansible ruglets -m shell -a "df -h"
```

```bash
# Check your playbook‚Äôs YAML and logic.
ansible-playbook --syntax-check ansible/playbooks/k3s_setup.yml
```

```bash
# Run the full deployment with verbose logging.
ansible-playbook -vv ansible/playbooks/k3s_setup.yml -i ansible/inventory.yml
```

```bash
# Run the playbook on a specific node only.
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/k3s_setup.yml --limit ruglet-1 -i ansible/inventory.yml
```

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Ping all ruglets via Ansible.
ansible ruglets -m ping
```

```bash
# View system logs for the K3s agent on all nodes.
ansible ruglets -m shell -a "journalctl -u k3s-agent"
```

```bash
# Last 50 lines of system logs.
ansible ruglets -m shell -a "tail -n 50 /var/log/syslog"
```
